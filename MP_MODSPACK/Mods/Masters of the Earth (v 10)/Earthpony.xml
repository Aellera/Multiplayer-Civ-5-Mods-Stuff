			<Text>Long long ago, before Equestria and the reign of Celestia existed 3 tribes of ponies. The Pegasi were the masters of the weather, making sure the weather was nice and perfect to grow food. The Unicorns were masters of the Sun and Moon, using their magic to bring night and day. The Earth Ponies were master of the dirt, responseable for growing food for all ponies. All 3 tribes lived in peace until a bizzare blizzard came to their lands. Food grew scarce, the 3 tribes fought with each other. It was decided that they would leave their lands and find a new home for themselves. Chancellor Puddinghead, leader of the Earth Ponies led them to what would become Equestria, naming their new land, Earth. The Earth Ponies were not alone as the other tribes had laid claim to the very same land. It was not until they could put aside their differences that they could stop the blizzard from claiming there new land. Thus is the story of Equestria's founding.</Text>
