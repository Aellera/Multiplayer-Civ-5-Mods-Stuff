			<Text>Long long ago, before Equestria and the reign of Celestia existed 3 tribes of ponies. The Earth Ponies were masters of the dirt, responseable for growing food for all ponies. The Unicorns were masters of the Sun and Moon, magically bringing night and day. The Pegasi were the masters of the weather, making sure the weather was nice and perfect to grow food. All 3 tribes lived in peace until a bizzare blizzard came to their lands. Food grew scarce, the 3 tribes fought with each other. It was decided that they would leave their lands and find a new home for themselves. Commander Hurricane, leader of the Pegasi, led them to what would become Equestria, naming their new land, Pegasopolis. It was not until they could put aside their differences that they could stop the blizzard from claiming there new land. Thus is the story of Equestria's founding.</Text>
